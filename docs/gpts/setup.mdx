# Connecting your GPT

To connect your custom GPT to Superface you need to add an Action to your GPT configuration. You can do this from the **Configure** section of the OpenAI GPT editor.

Open the configuration and scroll to the bottom of the screen until you see the **Actions** section, then click on **Create new action**

![The OpenAI Action setup can be found at the bottom of your GPT configuration page.](/img/gpts/openai-actions-button.png)

To set up a new action requires authentication, a schema and a privacy policy. All of these are provided on the **GPT Actions** section of Superface.

## Authentication

To set the authentication for your new Action, click on the cog icon in the authentication section at the top of the **Add actions** page.

![The OpenAI Action authentication settings.](/img/gpts/authentication.png)

The authentication settings dialogue will open.

The Authentication Type is _API Key_ and the _Auth Type_ is `Bearer`.

Copy the _Action Authentication Token_ from your GPT Actions page in Superface and paste it into the _API Key_ field.

Click on Save. Your authentication is now set up.

## Schema

Next, you need to import the action schema that defines the different tools that your GPT will be able to access. We recommend using the _Import from URL_ option for this.

![The schema setup section.](/img/gpts/schema.png)

Click on _Import from URL_ and paste the URL of the _Action Schema_ from your Superface GPT Actions settings. You can get this by clicking _Copy Import URL_.

After pasting your import URL in your GPT configuration, click on _Import_ and OpenAI will fetch the schema from Superface.

![Paste your Superface schema URL into the Import from URL text field.](/img/gpts/schema-paste.png)

Once the import has completed you will see the full schema loaded into the Schema window

![The imported schema will load into the schema textarea.](/img/gpts/imported-schema.png)

## Available actions

Once the schema is imported from Superface, you will see the full list of available actions that your GPT can use.

![The available actions all have their own button for testing.](/img/gpts/available-actions.png)

### Testing an action

Any of the available actions can be individually tested by clicking on Test. The results, or any errors, will be shown in the Preview window.

![All tests will show in the Preview pane on the right of the screen.](/img/gpts/test-preview.png)

## Privacy policy

Custom GPTs have the option of linking to an external Privacy Policy. To help you with this Superface automatically generates a bespoke Privacy Policy URL for you to use. It lists all the tools/APIs that your GPT will have access to and will stay up to date as you add or remove tools in future.

![Example of the Privacy Policy page that Superface generates for you.](/img/gpts/privacy-policy.png)

You can find the URL for the Privacy policy on the _GPT Actions_ settings page in Superface. It can be added to the _Privacy policy_ section of your Action settings in OpenAI.

:::warning
If you make your GPT public, users will have access to any of your connected tools and APIs using _your_ credentials.
