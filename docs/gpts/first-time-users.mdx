# Let's get started

After creating your Superface account, you will be directed to your GPT Actions configuration page.

If this is your first time using Superface, you will see the getting started guide.

In order to properly connect Superface to your GPT, you will need to have at least one tool installed. To get you moving quickly you can add the [Wttr.in](https://wttr.in) tool directly from this page by clicking **+ Add**.

Once the tool has been added, the page will refresh with the configuration details you need to connect your OpenAI custom GPT to Superface via an Action.
