# Quick Start (CLI)

Superface is all about providing you the best way to consume digital capabilities provided by APIs. This guide shows you how to get set up and use the Superface CLI to work with an API prodiver, as well as how to use the generated files in your project with the OneSDK.

:::info Before you start

Superface requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 16 or newer to be installed.

### Install & Authorize

Start by insalling the Superface CLI. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for this.

```shell
brew install superface
```

If you don't have a Superface account already, you can [sign up here](https://superface.ai/create-account). You can use your account to authenticate the CLI.

```shell
superface auth
```

### Prepare your use case

Superface accept Open API Specification format documentation, either from local files or remote URLs. You can also use the URL of any documentation hosted by [Readme.io](https://readme.io).

```shell
superface prepare <url or path to local file>
```

Once the documentation has been indexed, you can create a profile for the use case you want to achieve.

```shell
superface profile <provider-name> "your use case"
```

### Create code for your project

To turn the profile into the JavaScript map and boilerplate code, run the following command and include the name of the provider and the use case profile you want to use.

```shell
superface map <scope>.<profile-name>
```

### Test it

The resulting code is added to the `superface` folder in your project. To test it you can use the `execute` command.

```shell
$ superface execute superface/<scope>.<profile-name>.<provider-name>.mjs
```

:::note Provider authentication

In many cases you also need to set up provider credentials.
To learn how to handle API credentials, see [Setting provider API keys](../guides/api-keys.md).
