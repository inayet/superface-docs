# Superface in 3 minutes

Superface is all about providing you the best way to consume digital capabilities provided by APIs. This guide shows you how to pick a use case and its provider from our Catalog, and use Superface OneSDK to make the API call.

## Superface in 3 minutes

The following steps will help you get started with Superface and OneSDK.

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 14 or newer installed.

<div class="count-steps-h3">

### Pick a use case

This one is up to you. What do you want to achieve? A use case example would be _"Send an email and include click tracking"_, _"List all the users in a workspace"_, or _"Add users to a specific group"_.

Ultimately, your use case is up to you.

### Pick a provider

The next step is to **pick a provider you would like to use**. Again, this is up to you but we recommend you look for API providers that have Open API Specification versions of their documentation, or that host their documentation with Readme.io.

We've created some Quick Start guides for popular APIs such as [Notion](../api-examples/notion.mdx), [Slack](../api-examples/slack.mdx) and [Resend](../api-examples/resend.mdx).

:::note Provider authentication

In many cases you also need to set up provider credentials. Since we are using the unauthenticated GitHub API, we will skip that in this example.

To learn how to handle API credentials, see [Setting provider API keys](../guides/api-keys.md).

:::

### Install the Superface CLI

Start by insalling the Superface CLI. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for this.

```shell
brew install superface
```

If you don't have a Superface account already, you can [sign up here](https://superface.ai/create-account). You can use your account to authenticate the CLI.

```shell
superface auth
```

### Create your Comlinks

The CLI is used to create Comlinks. They handle use case definition, and the map thst is used to create the code you need for your app to talk to the provider you want to work with.

Start by indexing and preparing the documentation for the provider you want to use:

```shell
superface prepare <URL for provider documentation>
```

Next, create the profile for the use case you want to achieve, for example _"list all users"_:

```shell
superface profile <provider-name> "your use case"
```

After this step completes, you can use the profile that was created and turn it into a map that you can use in your application.

```shell
superface map <provider-name> <scope.use-case>
```

Don't worry if you don't know what to enter for `<provider-name>` and `<scope.use-case>`, the CLI presents the exact commands you need to run for each step directly in your terminal.

The output from these commands will be a folder named `superface` with the following files:

```shell
superface/
  <provider>.provider.json
  <scope>.<use-case>.profile
  <scope>.<use-case>.<provider>.map.js
  <scope>.<use-case>.<provider>.mjs
  context/
    <provider>.index.json
    <provider>.docs.txt
```

### Install OneSDK

In your app directory, install the OneSDK library:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk@alpha
```

### Code

Now you can use OneSDK in your app. Create an `index.mjs` file with the following JavaScript code:

```js title="index.mjs"
import { OneClient } from '@superfaceai/one-sdk';

async function main() {
  const client = new OneClient({
    assetsPath: './superface',
  });

  // Assign our CLI generated profile so it matches
  // the 'name' in the .profile file
  const profile = await client.getProfile('<profileName>');

  const result = await profile
    .getUseCase('<usecaseName>') // The <usecaseName> is also found in the .profile file
    .perform(
      {
        // Input parameters as defined in profile:
        '<key>': '<value>',
      },
      {
        provider: '<providerName>',
        parameters: {
          // Provider specific integration parameters:
          '<integrationParameterName>': '<integrationParameterValue>',
        },
        security: {
          // Provider specific security values:
          '<securityValueId>': {
            // Security values as described in provider or on profile page
          },
        },
      }
    );

  console.log(result.unwrap());
}

main();
```

<!--
:::note Profile version

Best practice is to pin your application to the latest version of the profile. By pinning the version you will get consistent output without breaking changes once new major version of the profile is published to Superface registry.

### Run

It's time to run your app! Because the Superface OneSDK is built with WASM, it requires that you pass the `--experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1` flag.

```shell
node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 index.mjs
```

### Check the HTTP communication

Set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `superface:http*` to see API calls from OneSDK to GitHub API:

```shell
DEBUG="superface:http*" node index.mjs
```

:::caution

This can print out potentially sensitive information, like API keys and access tokens.

:::

Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `superface*` to see everything that is going in under the hood.

```shell
DEBUG="superface*" node index.mjs
```

<!--### Understanding runtime integration

During the runtime of the application, OneSDK downloads a Comlink map from Superface servers. The Comlink map instructs the OneSDK how to make the call to GitHub API in order to perform the use case.

OneSDK also downloads the Comlink profile, which contains the definition of the use case for runtime. You can also provide local maps and profiles stored alongside your source code.

You can always check the Comlink map at the profile's detail page for a given provider by clicking the "raw" link. For example here's the [latest map for `vcs/user-repos` and `github`](https://superface.ai/raw/vcs/user-repos.github@2.0.suma).-->
