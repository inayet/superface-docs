# Quick Start (OneSDK)

The Superface OneSDK is the interface between your application, and the API provider you want to work with. It uses the [Comlinks generated by the Superface CLI](./quick-start.mdx) to perform the use cases you define.

Here's how you get it up and running in your project.

<div class="count-steps-h3">

### Install OneSDK

:::info Before you start

Superface OneSDK requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 18.0.0 or newer to be installed.

:::
In your app directory, install the OneSDK library:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk@beta
```

### Create your code

Create an `index.mjs` file with the following JavaScript code.

This example assumes that the Comlink files generated by the CLI will be a folder named `superface`, however if you have a different folder structure you can set the `assetsPath` as an option of the `OneClient()` set up below:

```js title="index.mjs"
import { OneClient } from '@superfaceai/one-sdk';

async function main() {
  const client = new OneClient({
    assetsPath: './superface',
    // token: <your-superface-token>
  });

  // Assign our CLI generated profile so it matches
  // the 'name' in the .profile file.
  // Example: email-communication/email-sending

  const profile = await client.getProfile('<profileName>');
  const useCase = profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>'); // The <usecaseName> is also found in the .profile file

  try {
    const result = await useCase
      .perform(
        {
          // Input parameters as defined in profile:
          <key>: '<value>',
        },
        {
          provider: '<providerName>',
          parameters: {
            // Provider specific integration parameters:
            '<integrationParameterName>': '<integrationParameterValue>',
          },
          security: {
            // Provider specific security values:
            '<securityValueId>': {
              // Security values as described in provider or on profile page
            },
          },
        }
      );

  // output result on success
    console.log("RESULT:", JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
  } catch(e) {
    // output result on error
    console.log("ERROR:", JSON.stringify(e, null, 2));
  }
}

main();
```

### Run

It's time to run your app! Because the Superface OneSDK is built with WASM, it requires that you pass the `--experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1` flag.

```shell
node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 index.mjs
```

### Debugging

Set the environment variable `ONESDK_LOG` to `on` to see API calls from OneSDK to the API you are connecting to:

```shell
ONESDK_LOG="on" node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 index.mjs
```

:::caution

This can print out potentially sensitive information, like API keys and access tokens.
