# Quick Start (OneSDK)

The Superface OneSDK is the interface between your application, and the API provider you want to work with. It uses the Comlinks generated by the Superface CLI to perform the use cases you define. Here's how you get it up and running in your project.

:::info Before you start

Superface OneSDK requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 16 or newer to be installed.

### Install

Start by insalling OneSDK into your project.

```shell
npm install superface/one-sdk@alpha-0.0.6
```

If you don't have a Superface account already, you can [sign up here](https://superface.ai/create-account). You can use your account to authenticate the CLI.

```shell
$ superface auth
```

### Prepare your use case

Superface accept Open API Specification format documentation, either from local files or remote URLs. You can also use the URL of any documentation hosted by [Readme.io](https://readme.io).

```shell
$ superface prepare <url or path to local file>
```

Once the documentation has been indexed, you can create a profile for the use case you want to achieve.

```shell
$ superface profile <provider> "your use case"
```

### Create code for your project

To turn the profile into the JavaScript map and boilerplate code, run the following command and include the name of the provider.

```shell
$ superface map <provider>
```

### Test it

The resulting code is added to the `superface` folder in your project. To test it you can use the `execute` command.

```shell
$ superface execute superface/<scope>.<profile-name>.<provider-name>.mjs
```

:::note Provider authentication

In many cases you also need to set up provider credentials.
To learn how to handle API credentials, see [Setting provider API keys](../guides/api-keys.md).
