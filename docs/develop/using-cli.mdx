# Using the CLI

This guide shows you how to set up and use the Superface CLI to work with an API provider to generate the Comlink files needed for the Superface tool you want to create.

:::info Before you start

Superface CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 18.0.0 or newer to be installed.

### Install & Authorize

The Superface CLI provides all the tooling needed to author the Comlinks for your tool.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="macos"
  values={[
    { label: 'macOS', value: 'macos' },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux' },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows' },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="macos">

```shell title="Install with Homebrew"
brew install superfaceai/cli/superface
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

```shell title="Install with NPM"
npm install -g @superfaceai/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

```shell title="Install with NPM"
npm install -g @superfaceai/cli@latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Developers with approved access will be able to log in using the following command.

```shell
superface login
```

If not, and you want to work with Superface, get in touch to arrange access.

### Prepare the documentation

To start building a tool, Superface must first understand the design of the API you want to connect to. It does this using Open API Specification format documentation, either from local files or remote URLs as well as the URL of any documentation hosted by [Readme.io](https://readme.io).

Locate the OAS for the service you want your tool to connect to and prepare it using this command:

```shell
superface prepare <url or path to local file> "<optional-provider-name>"
```

The minimum requirement for `prepare` is the URL or path to local file, however if you want to control the naming of the service your tool uses, you can do so by passing an additional name.

Once the documentation has been indexed by Superface, you can create a profile for the use case you want to achieve.

```shell
superface new <provider-name> "your tool use case"
```

If you want to have control over the name of your tool in the Superface UI you can specify the name as part of the `new` command, for example:

```shell
superface new resend "send an email" resend/send-an-email
```

### Create the code for your tool

To convert the profile into runnable code that you can edit (and that Superface can use), run the following command and include the name of the provider and the use case profile you want to use.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="nodejs"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node.js', value: 'nodejs' }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```shell
superface map <provider-name> <scope>/<use-case>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Test your tool locally

The resulting code is added to the `superface` folder in your project. To test it you can use the `execute` command.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="nodejs"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node.js', value: 'nodejs' }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="nodejs">

```shell
superface execute <provider> <scope>/<use-case>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Provider authentication

In many cases you also need to set up provider credentials. The CLI will inform you of the name of the variable that should be added to your development environment. To learn how to handle API credentials, see [Setting provider API keys](../guides/api-keys.md).

:::

### What files are created?

After running all the above commands, you will find a folder named `superface` in your current working directory, with the following structure:

```shell
superface/
  <provider-name>.provider.json
  <scope>.<use-case>.profile
  <scope>.<use-case>.<provider-name>.map.js
  <scope>.<use-case>.<provider-name>.mjs
```

These files are used by OneSDK to enabled your application to communicate with the provider you are working with. `<provider-name>`, `<scope>`, and `<use-case>` will be replaced with real values based on the provider and use case you specified.

### Additional commands

`superface whoami` shows the current logged in user.

`superface logout` logs out the current user.

`--quiet` or `-q` flag will reduce the amount of terminal output you see.

For information on each CLI command you can run `superface --help` at any time.
