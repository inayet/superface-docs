# Integrations monitoring

Superface comes with out-of-the-box monitoring of integrations used by your App. With Superface project you will get insights on your App's API dependencies and their health status. In case of use-case failure, you will also receive an email notification with details about the failing API calls.

## Set up integrations monitoring

### Prerequisites

- Node.js app with OneSDK and a use case set up; see [Getting&nbsp;started](../getting-started.mdx) to create one
- Registered account on [superface.ai](https://superface.ai/) to access insights

### Create new project

Create a new project in [Superface](/insights).

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

### Get your SDK token

Copy the project's SDK token.

### Use the SDK token with your Application

In command line, set the token as `SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN` environment variable:

```shell
export SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN="<your token>"
```

Or set the `sdkAuthToken` parameter during SDK client initialization:

```javascript
const sdk = SuperfaceClient({ sdkAuthToken: '<your token>' });
```

Run your application again:

```shell
node index.js
```

### Check Insights

Observe how are the use-cases used by your application.
