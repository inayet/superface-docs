# Debugging OneSDK

Understanding the types of communication and errors you might see when running an application using OneSDK is key to maintaing a fast workflow with Superface.

Below is a list of all the debugging options available in OneSDK and what you can use each one for.

## Using environment variables

You can set the debug level for OneSDK via your environment. There are two options and you can use one or both of them at the same time.

### ONESDK_LOG

```shell
ONESDK_LOG=warn #trace, error, info, warn
```

`ONESDK_LOG` sets the general logging level for OneSDK. You can choose from four different logging verbosity levels:

#### Warn

What does Warn do...

#### Error

What does Error do...

#### Info

What does Info do...

#### Trace

What does Trace do...

### ONESDK_DEV_LOG

The OneSDK Dev Log is a greater level of depth, and can be switched on to provide...

```shell
ONESDK_DEV_LOG=on #off, on
```

## Setting debug options at runtime

You can also pass these variables to your application at runtime. For example:

```shell
DEBUG=warn node index.mjs
```
