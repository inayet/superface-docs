# Using the agent interface
After logging in to Superface, you will see a fresh agent interface ready to get started with your prompts.

If it's your first time using the agent, there probably won't be any tools set up yet. You can check this by asking `What can you do?`.

:::tip
In Superface term, "Tools" are what connects the agent to your external services.

To get started, you will need to add some tools. You can do this by clicking on **Settings**.

## Task history
To access previous tasks, click on **History**. A drawer of your previous tasks (and any scheduled tasks) will appear on the left of the screen.
