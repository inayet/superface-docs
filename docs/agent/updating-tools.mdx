# Updating tools
You can update the tools you have available in Superface at any time by clicking on the edit icon.

![A list of tools in the Superface agent that are available to use](/img/agent/5-updating-tools.png)

This will take you to the **Add Comlinks** section where you can re-upload new files for the tool you want to make changes to.

![The Upload Comlinks screen is where you can edit tools by uploading new files](/img/agent/2-add-new-comlinks.png).

Drag and drop your updated/edited files and they will overwrite the previous versions if the naming convention used has not changed.

:::tip
You only need to upload the files that you have made changes to. If nothing has changed in the profile, or provider files, you don't need to add these because they already exist in Superface.
