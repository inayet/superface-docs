# Superface Agent

The Superface Agent allows you to interact with SaaS platforms via natural language prompts.

:::note Availability
Our Agent is currently in a closed beta. If you are interested in checking it out, please [book a demo](https://superface.ai/get-demo).
:::

The Agent is based around the same concept of tools as Superface for GPTs, but presents an chat-style interface for you to interact with any API you have connected. The agent enables you to:

- Schedule and re-run tasks.
- Take advantage of a wide selection of pre-built tools for Google, Jira, Zendesk, and others.
- Create new tools for any API using browser a based interface.
