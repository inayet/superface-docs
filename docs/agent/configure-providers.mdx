# Configuring providers
All Superface tools have a *provider* as part of their configuration. The provider is where necessary elements such as API keys, and additional parameters that are needed to connect to an external service are defined.

![A list of Providers in Superface](/img/agent/3-configuring-providers.png)

The providers are listed in alpabetical order of the name of the external service they represent.

A fully configured provider will have a green dot next to it. If it's green, it's good to go.

If there is a red dot next to the name then some additional configuration is needed.

## Setting configurations
To set up configuration options for a provider you can click on the cog icon to see the specific settings required.

For example, here are the configuration parameters required for the Mixpanel provider shown in the image above.

Typically a provider outlines the security configuration as well as any additional parameters that are required by the third-party API your tool is connecting to. In this case we can see that Mixpanel requires both of these.

To set up your provider, fill out all of the blank fields and click **Save Changes**.

## Provider file example
Below you can see the provider file for Mixpanel. This is where the parameters and security scheme detals you can see on the screen are defined.

```json
{
  "name": "mixpanel",
  "defaultService": "default",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "project_id",
      "description": "The ID of the Mixpanel project"
    },
    {
      "name": "workspace_id",
      "description": "The ID of the workspace to query"
    }
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "baseUrl": "https://eu.mixpanel.com/api/query",
      "id": "default"
    }
  ],
  "securitySchemes": [
    {
      "type": "http",
      "scheme": "basic",
      "id": "ServiceAccount"
    }
  ]
}
```
