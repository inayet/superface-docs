# Changing models
By default Superface uses the *OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo* model, however this may not necessarily be the best model for all the capabilities you want to add with your tools.

You can modify the model that the agent uses by clicking on **Settings > System** and selecting the model you want to run your tools with from the **Foundation model** drop down list.
