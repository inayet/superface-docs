# Welcome to Superface

**Superface is an AI powered agent that helps you make informed decisions by consolidating real-time data from multiple sources to answer queries posed using natural language.**

- Connects to your SaaS applications via their APIs.
- Works in real-time to get you the most up to date information.
- Uses custom tools that you can develop, with almost limitless possibilty.
- Unlike other agents, Superface offers task automations, replays and scheduling.
- Requires no BI training to use because it speaks your language(s).

## How it works
Superface connects to your systems and SaaS applications and works in real-world scenarios. This is achieved by the use of custom "tools" that can be created to connect to any service that has an API.
