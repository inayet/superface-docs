# What is Superface?

Superface is an AI-powered developer toolkit made up of a CLI and SDK that make creating API integrations faster, and more manageable by helping you think about _the use cases_ you want to achieve, _not_ how you need to write the code for the API to achieve it, allowing you to focus on developing what matters.
