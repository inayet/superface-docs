# Binary Data

Use the `BinaryData` class in OneSDK to upload content by streaming bytes.

:::info

To use this feature, you will need OneSDK for NodeJS at version `2.2.0` or higher.

:::


The following interface is available in OneSDK, as well as inÂ [Comlink Map's Script](https://superface.ai/docs/comlink/map#sec-Script):

```ts
export interface IBinaryData {
  peek(size?: number): Promise<Buffer | undefined>;
  getAllData(): Promise<Buffer>;
  chunkBy(chunkSize: number): AsyncIterable<Buffer>;
  toStream(): Readable;
}
```

If a `BinaryData` instance is used as the body or value in `FormData`, the content is streamed. This allows you to upload and work with large files.

Currently, `BinaryData` can't be used in the result of a use case. If it is present, an `UnexpectedError` is returned instead. You can use the `getAllData()` function to read and return the contents as a `Buffer`, which is valid to use in a use case result. Later, support for streamed results will be added for situations when the content is too big to load into memory.

## Comlink Map examples

In this section, you will find example uses of `BinaryData` in Comlink maps.

### Sending a file as the body of a POST request
```
map SendFile {
  http POST "/resource" {
    request "application/octet-stream" {
      body = input.file
    }

    response 200 "text/plain" {
      map result body
    }
  }
}
```

### Sending multiple files as FormData fields, alongside other fields
```
map SendFile {
  http POST "/resource" {
    request "multipart/form-data" {
      body {
        field = input.field
        file1 = input.file1
        file2 = input.file2
      }
    }

    response 200 "text/plain" {
      map result body
    }
  }
}
```

### Uploading a file in chunks
```
profile = "example@1.0"
provider = "localhost"

map ChunkedUpload {
  uploadResults = call foreach(chunk of input.file.chunkBy(10)) Upload(chunk = chunk)

  return map result uploadResults
}

operation Upload {
  http POST "/upload/{args.uploadId}" {
    request "application/octet-stream" {
      body = args.chunk
    }

    response 200 "text/plain" {
      return true
    }

    response 500 "text/plain" {
      return false
    }
  }
}
```

### Reading from a file, then sending it as the body of a request

This serves as a workaround for MIME type detection.
```
map SendFile {
  firstTen = input.file.peek(10)

  contentType = firstTen.toString('ascii').toLowerCase().includes('pdf') ? 'application/pdf' : 'application/octet-stream'

  http POST "/resource" {
    request {
      headers {
        'content-type' = contentType
      }
      
      body = input.file

    response 200 "text/plain" {
      map result body
    }
  }
}
```

### Updating BinaryData from a Comlink Map
```
map Example {
  tmp = (input.file.name = input.filename)
  tmp = (input.file.mimetype = input.mimetype)
  
  http POST "/" {
    request "multipart/form-data" {
      body = {
        file: input.file
      }
    }
  
    response 200 {
      map result body
    }
  }
}
```

## OneSDK use example

```typescript
import { SuperfaceClient, BinaryData } from '@superfaceai/one-sdk';

const client = new SuperfaceClient();
const profile = await client.getProfile('example');

// for files
const result = await profile.getUseCase('Example').perform({
  binary: BinaryData.fromPath(pathToFile, { mimetype: 'text/plain', filename: 'example.txt' });

// or for Readable streams
const stream = getReadableStream();
const result = await profile.getUseCase('Example').perform({
  binary: BinaryData.fromStream(stream);
});
```

## Limitations

### 1. Asynchronous operations on BinaryData

A current limitation of `BinaryData` use in Comlink Maps is that the `peek`, `read` and `getAllData` methods are all asynchronous. This means that they can't be directly chained with methods on [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/buffer.html#class-buffer), such as `toString()`.

To overcome this limitation, `BinaryData` must first be [assigned to a variable](https://spec.superface.dev/latest/map-spec.html#sec-Set-Variables), so that the interpreter resolves the Promise:
```
map Example {
  firstBytes = input.binary.peek(10)
  data = input.binary.read(10)
  remainingData = input.binary.getAllData()

  map result {
    firstBytes = firstBytes
    data = data
   remainingData = remainingData
  }
}
```

### 2. Opaque data type

In a Comlink profile, the type must be omitted for now. Later, a new [Primitive type](https://spec.superface.dev/latest/profile-spec.html#sec-Primitive-types) representing binary data will be added.

```
name = "example"
version = "1.0.0"

usecase Example {
  input {
    binary
  }
}
```

### 3. Assigning to temporary variables when altering BinaryData

Comlink maps right now don't support using Script expressions as statements. The only workaround for now is to use variable assignment.

```
tmp = (input.file.name = input.filename)
```
