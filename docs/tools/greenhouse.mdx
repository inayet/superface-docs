# Greenhouse

The Greenhouse tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- Retrieve all jobs using the `board_token`, returning a list of jobs.
- Retrieve specific job detail using the job ID.

## Requirements

You will need a [Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.com/) board or job ID. This can be found in the URL of a job board.

For example:

- The board ID in `https://boards.greenhouse.io/prefect/` is `prefect`
- The job ID in `https://boards.greenhouse.io/techstars57/jobs/7117490002` is `7117490002`

## Authentication

This tool uses data for publicly available job boards powered by Greenhouse and does not require any authentication.

:::note Import your schema

Remember to re-import the schema in your GPT to update it with the new capabilities added by this tool.

## Example prompts

To test that everything is working as it should be, from your GPT or the Superface Agent you can try asking:

- Show me all the jobs for board `<board id>`.
- List all the jobs from board `<board id>` that are older than 60 days.
- Show me the details for `<job id>` on from `<board id`.
