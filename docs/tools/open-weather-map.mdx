# OpenWeatherMap

The OpenWeatherMap tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- Retrieve current weather information for a specified location.

## Requirements

You will need an [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API account and an API key.

There is a free plan available that offers up to 1000 API calls per day for free, however any overages will be billed meaning that a credit card is required to activate the account.

## Authentication
