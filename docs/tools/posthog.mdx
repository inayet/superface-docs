# PostHog

The PostHog tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- Fetch session recording detail from the PostHog API using the Project ID and Session Recording ID.
- Retrieve a list of events for a specified project using its ID.
- Retrieve the list of projects for the current organization.
- Retrieve a list of session recordings for a specific project using the project ID.

## Requirements

You will need:

- A [PostHog](https://posthog.com) account
- A personal API key.
- The geographic location of your PostHog account (either US or EU).

## Authentication

Start by setting up a Personal API key in PostHog, that will allow Superface to access your account.

To do this, open your PostHog account settings and click on _User > Personal API Keys_.

Click **Create personal API key** and set up a new API key specifically for Superface.

Next, in Superface, click on the config button for the PostHog tool.

Set the `DOMAIN` field in the Parameters section to either:

- `app` if your PostHog account is using their US Cloud location
- `eu` if using their EU location

Then enter the API key you created in the `Token` field.

Click on _Save Changes_ and the PostHog tool is ready to use.

## Project IDs in PostHog

Some of the capabilities the PostHog tool offers require you to supply a `project_id`. You will be prompted to enter this in order to complete any tasks that require it. If you can't remember the project ID you can use the _"List Project IDs"_ prompt to see all the projects you have access to and their associated IDs.

## Example prompts

To test that everything is working as it should be, from your GPT or the Superface Agent you can try asking:

- Show me a list of session recordings
- List Project IDs
- Show me events from the past 24 hours
