# Notion

The Notion tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- List users in a Notion workspace

## Requirements

You will need a pre-existing Notion workspace with Workspace Owner permission to set up an Internal Integration. This can be done from the [My Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) section of Notion. If you cannot access this, please ask your Notion workspace owner.

- Click on _Create new integration_.
- Select the workspace to associate the integration with.
- Choose a name for your integration (we recommend _Superface_).
- Click on Submit.

Now your integration is setup, you can copy the _Internal Integration Token_ from the _Secrets_ tab.
