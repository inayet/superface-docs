# IBM NLU (Sentiment Analysis)

The IBM Natural Language Understanding tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- Analyze Sentiment

## Set up NLU

In order to use the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding tool you will first need to register an account. You can do this via the [IBM Cloud website](https://www.ibm.com/products/natural-language-understanding).

Once you have an account you will need to create a Natural Language Understanding instance. You can do this from the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?category=ai&search=label%3Aibm_created).

You must choose the region that your NLU instance will be created in. If you are not sure, choose the city that is closest to you.

We recommend choosing the Lite pricing plan which offers 30,000 NLU items per month for free. If you need more than this you can always upgrade later.

## Authentication

To use the IBM Natural Language Understanding tool with Superface you will need the API key for the NLU instance you have created. You can find this through the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources) in your IBM Cloud account.

In the Superface config for the IBM NLU tool you need to enter values for three fields:

1. The `REGION` is the location of your NLU instance. You can find this by looking at the URL in the credentials section, for example `eu-de` is the location code for Frankfurt.
2. The username should be set to `apikey`.
3. In the password field you can paste your API Key.
