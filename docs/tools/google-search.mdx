# Google Search

The Google Search tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- Perform a custom search

## Requirements

The Google Custom Search API requires a Google Cloud Account. You can set up a free edition [via the documentation](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction).

Additionally, you will need a Programmable Search Engine. This is a custom search engine that you define for yourself. It can either be a specific set of pages, or the entire web.

To set up a Programmable Search Engine, follow the steps outlined in the [PSE Control Panel](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel).

## Authentication

In order to use the Google Search tool you must generate an API Key for that capability in Google Cloud. You can do this directly from the [Programmable Search Engine](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction) documentation by clicking on _Get a key_ button.

Now you should have:

- A CX ID for your Programmable Search Engine (They look like this: `e522fcff67c3e4d4b`).
- An API Key with ability to access Programmable Search Engine.

You can add these into the configuration for the Google Search tool in Superface by clicking on the Config button.
