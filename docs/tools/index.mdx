# Managing Tools

Tools sit at the heart of Superface. They connect you to the APIs of the platforms you want to use from your GPT, or with our Agent.

There are two types of tools:

1. Pre-built tools provided by Superface.
2. Tools that you can develop yourself.

In this guide we will look at adding and managing the tools provided by Superface. If you want to start developing tools of your own, start with our [Developing Superface Tools](../develop/index.mdx) guides.
