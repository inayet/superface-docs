Start by clicking _Create a Private App_.

Give your app a name. You can use "Superface" to keep things clear or have HubSpot generate a random name for you. A logo and description are not required.

Next, click on _Scopes_, this will allow you to select the permissions your application (or in this case, Superface), can access. Select all of the CRM scopes shown below.

Complete the setup by clicking _Create App_. You will then be shown the PAT (Personal Access Token) that you can use to authenticate Superface. You can copy it from the pop up and it is available at any time from the _Auth_ section of your Prviate App settings.
