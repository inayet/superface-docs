# Resend

The Resend tool for Superface allows you to quickly add the following capabilities:

- Send an email with optional cc, bcc, and replyTo inputs.

## Requirements

You will need an [Resend](https://resend.com) account and a API key with _sending access_ permission.

## Authentication

From your Resend dashboard, click on _API Keys_, then the _Create API Key_ button.

In the popup:

- Set a name for your API Key.
- Set the Permission to _Sending access_.
- Select a specific sending domain if you have one, otherwise use All Domains.

Click on _Add_ to create the new API key.

For security reasons Resend will only show you the API key _once_, so you must copy it immediately. You will not be able to access this key later.

Next, in Superface, click on the Config button for the Resend tool and paste your Resend API Key into the `Token` field in the Security section.

## Example prompts

To test that everything is working as it should be, from your GPT or the Superface Agent you can try asking:

- Send an email from `<email-address>` to `<email-address>` with the subject "Hello, World!" and the message "Live and direct from Superface".
