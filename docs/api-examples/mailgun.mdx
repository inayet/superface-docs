# Mailgun

In this example, we will show you how you can get started working with the [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com/) email API to produce a working use case that allows you to send an email from an application.

:::info Before you start

You'll need a Mailgun username and password. Find out how to set that up in the [Resend documentation](https://resend.com/docs/introduction).

### Install & Authorize Superface

Start by insalling the Superface CLI. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for this.

```shell
brew install superfaceai/cli/superface
```

If you don't have a Superface account already, you can [sign up here](https://superface.ai/create-account). You can use your account to authenticate the CLI.

```shell
superface login
```
