# Resend

In this example, we will show you how you can get started working with the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com) and produce a working use case that allows you to list all of the users in your Notion workspace.

:::info Before you start

You'll need to get an API token for a _Notion Internal Integration_ that is valid for the workspace you want to access. Find out how to set that up in the [Notion Authorization documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#making-api-requests-with-an-internal-integration).

### Install & Authorize Superface

Start by insalling the Superface CLI. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for this.

```shell
$ brew install superface
```

If you don't have a Superface account already, you can [sign up here](https://superface.ai/create-account). You can use your account to authenticate the CLI.

```shell
$ superface auth
```

### Prepare the documentation

Notion's documentation is hosted by Readme.io, which is a format that Superface can accept without any additional changes so you can copy and paste the URL for the `GET users` endpoint.

```shell
$ superface prepare https://developers.notion.com/reference/get-users
```

Once the documentation has been indexed, you can create a profile for the use case you want to achieve.

```shell
$ superface profile notion "list all users"
```

### Create code for your project

To turn the profile into the JavaScript map and boilerplate code, run the following command and include the name of the provider.

```shell
$ superface map notion
```

### Test it

:::note Don't forget your authentication

Superface expects an authorization token for Notion. You can add this as `NOTION_TOKEN` in your environment. To learn more how to handle API credentials, see [Setting provider API keys](../guides/api-keys.md).

:::

The resulting code from the previous step is added to the `superface` folder in your project. To test it you can use the `execute` command.

```shell
$ superface execute superface/<scope>.<profile-name>.<provider-name>.mjs
```
