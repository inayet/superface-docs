# Introduction

Superface is the AI for APIs. It makes creating API integrations faster, and more management so you can focus on developing your application.

## Benefits of using Superface

💸 **Developing integrations over and over is expensive**. Use integrations developed by others, just as you'd use npm packages or crates.

🔐 **Your data is safe**, Superface isn't a proxy nor a middle-man.

🎓 This approach gives you a framework to **decouple the lifecycle of your application and the integrations it uses**.

🧐 Superface is a language and a protocol for abstracting integrations as application use cases. Allowing you to unify your integration approach in code regardless of the API provider.

:::caution Deprecation Notice
We recently started deprecating the previous version of Superface CLI, OneSDK and our provider use case catalog. If you are looking for the documentation for these, check out our [Classic Docs](./classic) section.
